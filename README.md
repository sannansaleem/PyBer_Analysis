# PyBer Analysis
*In depth analysis for PyBer, a Ride-Share company*

## Project Overview and Background
### Purpose
The purpose of the following anlysis is to conduct an in depth investigation for the Ride-Share company *PyBer* as well as display our understanding of the data using visualization thechniques within the python graphing library A.K.A *Matplotlib*. Illustrating the relationship between the type of the city -- urban, suburban and rural -- and their correlation between rides, drivers and fares, the data sources:
  - [city_data.csv](Resources/city_data.csv)
  - [ride_data.csv](Resources/ride_data.csv)
  
uses accumulateed data from January to early May of 2019 on the following metrics: 
-	The total number of rides for each city type. 
-	The total number of drivers for each city type.
-	The sum of the fares for each city type.
-	The average fare per ride for each city type.
-	The average fare per driver for each city type.
-	The total fares for each week by city type. 

With a focus on exploratorty data analysis techniques (EDA) we are able to sort, clean, and create smaller data sets that are not only far easier to work with when coming to conclusions, but is also far easier for the end user to understand along with our supporting charts/graphs

## Results 
 
Using the table below *(A dataframe that summarizes the data per city type)* we are able to conclude results for each city type 
1. urban 
2. suburban 
3. rural 

as they correlate to the amount of rides, drivers and fares using urban cities as our baseline reading.

<ins> **1.	The total number of rides for each city type.** </ins>
  -	The total amount of rides is approx. 2.6-times higher in urban cities when compared to suburban cities.
  -	The total amount of rides is approx. 13-times higher in urban cities when compared to rural cities.

<ins>**2.	The total number of drivers for each city type.**</ins>
  -	The total amount of drivers is almost approx. 5-times :arrow_up: in urban cities when compared to suburban cities.
  -	The total amount of drivers is almost approx. 31-times :arrow_up: in urban cities when compared to rural cities.

<ins>**3.	The sum of the fares for each city type.**</ins>
  -	The total amount of fares is approx. 2-times :arrow_up: in urban cities when compared to suburban cities. 
  -	The total amount of fares is approx. 9-times :arrow_up: in urban cities when compared to rural cities.

<ins>**4.	The average fare per ride for each city type.**</ins>
  -	The average fare per ride is approx. 1.3-times :arrow_down: in urban cities when compared to suburban.
  -	The average fare per ride is approx. 1.4-times :arrow_down: in urban cities when compared to rural cities.

<ins>**5.	The average fare per driver for each city type.**</ins>
  -	The average fare per driver is approx. 2.4-times :arrow_down: in urban cities when compared to suburban cities.
  -	The average fare per driver is spprox. 3.3-times :arrow_down: in urban cities when compared to rural cities.

<ins>**6.	The total fares for each week by city type.**</ins>

An examination of the stacked line graph that presents us the *Total Fare by City Type* we are able to conclude the results for each city type â€“ urban, suburban and rural as it relates to the total fare amount per week.

</p>

  -	Urban cities present with the highest total overall fares, ranging from approx. $1,600 per week to approx. $2,500 per week. 
  -	Rural cities have the lowest overall total fares, ranging from approx. $250 per week to approx. $500 per week.
  -	Suburban cities fall in between rural and urban ranging from approx. $650 per week to approxx. $1,450 per week.
  -	All cities have pretty steady flow of total fares from week to week with a matching spikes in the third week in February. Results in comparing urban ot suburban to rural make sense as the more densly populated an individual are, the more fares it recieves i.e. urban being the most populated, rural being the least, and suburban falling inbetween.

## Summary 
To summarize, te results above present to us a disproportionality amongst the distribution of rides wherein more densely populated areas (urban > suburban > rural) present with a higher number of not only rides but also drivers, yet their avg. fare per ride and driver is lower that that of suburban and rural cities.

such so to balance out incomes for PyBer amogst the cities the following reccomendations could be made:

1. Rural cities currently present with a higher rider to driver ratio implying the demand for drivers is currently not being met and so PyBer should look into collecting and analysing more data in rural cities specifically pertatining to drivers in order to increase total driver count which would imply a greater revenue within rural cities.
2. There seems to a peak in all 3 cities during the month of february, further investigation into this may lead to an effective and strategic plan to capitalize on this trend.
3. A profitatbility analysis by city type maybe useful to determine weather any incentives can be given to a certian geolocation to further incentivise drivers/riders in that area to boost margins.
